# Commit Summary for The Forge Project

## Repository: https://github.com/ANSH-RIYAL/Apocrypha

## Recent Updates (Latest Session):
### Consideration Auto-Filling System Enhancement
- **Enhanced AI Prompting**: Updated system prompt to include explicit instructions for auto-filling consideration content
- **Structured Data Format**: Implemented new consideration data structure with `content`, `previous_value`, `metadata`, and `is_complete` fields
- **Boolean Completion Status**: Changed completion tracking from word-count calculation to boolean `is_complete` flag determined at update time
- **Auto-Extraction Logic**: Added methods to extract consideration updates from AI responses using structured format
- **Response Cleaning**: Implemented response cleaning to remove consideration update sections before sending to frontend
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained support for existing string-based considerations while migrating to new format
- **Debugging Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline for better debugging
- **Format Enforcement**: Updated prompts to ensure AI responses use plain text without bold formatting or markdown

### Technical Improvements:
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added robust error handling and logging in `app.py`, `openai_service.py`, and `data_manager.py`
- **Session Management**: Improved session loading and consideration tracking
- **API Response Structure**: Maintained existing API response format while adding consideration updates
- **Local Development Setup**: Created `.env` file for local development with proper environment variables

## Changes Made:
