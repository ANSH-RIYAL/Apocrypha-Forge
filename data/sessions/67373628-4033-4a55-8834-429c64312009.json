      "ai_response": "Absolutely, this is a great starting point for a startup plan. Let's first clarify the problem you're addressing. How do these manual data management practices impact the efficiency and quality of healthcare in rural clinics? Understanding the pain points will help in defining the problem clearly.\n\nOnce we have a solid problem definition, we can identify your target market. Are you focusing on specific regions or types of healthcare facilities?Let's tackle these two considerations first before moving on to the rest."
