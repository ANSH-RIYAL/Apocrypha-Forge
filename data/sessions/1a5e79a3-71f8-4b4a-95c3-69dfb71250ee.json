      "ai_response": "Absolutely, that's a great starting point for a startup! Let's break it down into our core considerations to develop a comprehensive plan.\n\nFirst, let's refine the problem definition. You mentioned rural clinics and manual data management. Can you elaborate on the challenges these clinics face and the impact it has on healthcare delivery?\n\nAfter that, we can define your target market. Who do you envision will be the primary users of this EHR system? Are there specific types of clinics or regions you're focusing on?\n\nThese two areas will set a solid foundation for your startup plan. Once we have these, we can move on to the solution approach and other considerations."
