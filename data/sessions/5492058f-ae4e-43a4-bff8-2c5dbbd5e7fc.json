    "problem_definition": "Rural clinics encounter severe challenges with manual patient data management, which leads to multiple inefficiencies and risks. These include data entry errors, time-consuming processes for retrieving records, and the frequent occurrence of lost or damaged paper files. Access to complete patient histories during emergencies is often limited, which can critically impact patient care. Additionally, clinics struggle with tracking patient outcomes due to inadequate data analytics capabilities, and they face compliance issues related to medical record-keeping standards. The inability to share patient information with other healthcare providers compounds these challenges, significantly affecting the quality of care. This situation increases the administrative burden on healthcare workers and creates substantial barriers to practicing evidence-based medicine in rural settings.",
    "target_market": "The primary target market for this solution includes rural healthcare clinics, community health centers, and small medical practices located in developing countries and remote areas. These facilities often struggle with limited infrastructure and unreliable internet connectivity, which makes traditional EHR systems impractical. By focusing on these regions, we aim to provide a tailored solution that addresses their unique challenges. Additionally, this market may include non-profit organizations and government health initiatives that support healthcare improvement in underserved areas, as they are often key stakeholders in the adoption of new healthcare technologies.",
    "solution_approach": "The proposed solution is a lightweight web application designed specifically for low-bandwidth environments. This EHR system will offer offline functionality, allowing healthcare providers to access and input patient data without needing a constant internet connection. When connectivity is available, data will sync seamlessly to ensure that patient records are updated and backed up in a secure cloud environment. The application will use local data storage to maintain functionality in offline mode, ensuring that critical patient information is always accessible. Additionally, the system will feature an intuitive user interface tailored to the technological capabilities and needs of rural healthcare workers, minimizing training requirements and facilitating ease of use. This approach not only addresses the connectivity challenges but also enhances the overall efficiency and reliability of patient data management in rural clinics.",
